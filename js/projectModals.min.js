The negative tweets then have their negative words changed to be positive, and the user is returned only tweets that are positive either naturally or thanks to the algorithm.",technologies:["Python","TensorFlow","TweePy","NLTK"],imageType:"",image2Type:"",link:"https://github.com/AI-at-GBC/tweet-analysis"},{name:"Speaker Recognition",subtitle:"ML for Voice Classification",description:"In order to learn data pre-processing and data classification, we created speaker recognition algorithms.
